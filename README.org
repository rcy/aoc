* Advent of Code 2018

This is the first code I have written using Go!

The aim is not to have the most elegant code, or solve the problems
quickly, but to get working knowledge of the language and to have fun.

* Day 01

I wrote the code to part A, and then copied the file over and modified
it for part B.  Going forward I will try to have a single file with
both solutions in it.

* Day 02

Worked with arrays.  Didn't use a scanner to process the input file
line by line like I did on day 1, but instead read it all in as bytes
and converted to string, then split into array.
